# Test Steps
# Use shared components when possible for consistency and reusability

# 1. App Launch (recommended to use shared component)
- runFlow: ../shared-components/navigation/app-launch.yaml

# 2. Navigation steps
- tapOn: "Button Text"
- tapOn:
    id: elementId
    
# 3. Input actions
- inputText: "Test Data"
- inputText: "${VARIABLE_NAME}"

# 4. Assertions (add liberally - don't just navigate!)
- assertVisible: "Expected Text"
- assertVisible:
    id: expectedElement
    
# 5. Advanced actions (if needed)
- scrollUntilVisible:
    element: "Target Element"
    direction: DOWN
    timeout: 5000
    
- extendedWaitUntil:
    visible: "Loading Complete"
    timeout: 10000
    
# 6. Conditional actions (if needed)
- tapOn:
    text: "Optional Button"
    optional: true
    
# 7. Use shared components for common end actions
- runFlow: ../shared-components/validations/assert-success.yaml

# Example of a complete simple test:
# - runFlow: ../shared-components/navigation/app-launch.yaml
# - tapOn: "Login"
# - tapOn:
#     id: usernameField
# - inputText: "${TEST_USER}"
# - tapOn:
#     id: passwordField  
# - inputText: "${TEST_PASSWORD}"
# - tapOn: "Sign In"
# - assertVisible: "Welcome"
# - runFlow: ../shared-components/validations/assert-home-screen.yaml
